# DynoCC Modules

Modules were originally implemented by StrandCC. They are a series of commands that are designed to be configured and toggled.  Each Module has it's own seperate setup command to configure and or create channels and roles with.

### Guide
We assume you are using the default command prefix, `?`. Commands with inputs are denoted as ``?command [input]``. Commands with choice inputs are denoted as ``?command [input1/input2]``. Commands with optional inputs are denoted as ``?command (input)``.
