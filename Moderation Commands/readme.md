# Moderation Commands

We assume you are using the `?` prefix. Input will be denoted as `[input]` and multi-choice inputs will be written as `[input1/input2]`, respectively.

Used Roles in these commands:  
`Moderator` - High level role, above Administrator. These users should be able to access multiple server settings.
