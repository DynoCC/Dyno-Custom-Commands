# Command Snippets
A command group designed by Sobriquet#0001

> The Command Snippets Module let you save command snippets as mentionable roles, which you can execute together using a single command.

## Guide Markdown  
We assume you are using the default command prefix, `?`. Commands with inputs are denoted as ``?command [input]``. Commands with choice inputs are denoted as ``?command [input1/input2]``. Commands with optional inputs are denoted as ``?command (input)``.

## Commands
* `?register [...command]` - Add a command as a snippet (a mentionable role). Users must have Server Admin. 
* `?run [...snippet]` - Execute snippets by mentioning them. Users must have Server Moderator. 
* `?unregister [snippet]` - Deletes a snippet. Users must have Server Admin.
