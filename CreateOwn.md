You can create a command using Dyno's many variables. Below, you can see many resources for creating a new command, including the list of all the variables.

You can add a command to your own server through the [Dyno dashboard](https://dyno.gg/).

Once you create a command, you can add it to the Dyno Custom Commands list through GitHub [here](https://github.com/DynoCC/Dyno-Custom-Commands/new/master).
The file name should be "command name.txt", and the file content should be the command response.
