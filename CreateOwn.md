# Create Your Own Command
You can create a command using Dyno's many variables. Below, you can see many resources for creating a new command, including the list of all the variables.

(There is more info after the resources embed.)

You can add a command to your own server through the [Dyno dashboard](https://dyno.gg/).

## Adding to DCC
Once you create a command, you can add it to the Dyno Custom Commands list through GitHub [here](https://github.com/DynoCC/Dyno-Custom-Commands/new/master).
The file name should be "command name.txt" (obviously `command name` should be the name of the command), and the file content should be the command response.
