## Reports Module
This module is for users to send private reports to the staff. To use it you will need the following channels.

 - reports
 - report-log


The `reports` commaned can be used the create all required channels for you. Once the channels are made, you will need to move the `report-log` channel to an area visible only to serverMods so as to ensure  the reports remaain private.

You should also post a message into the reports channel providing the arguments to provide for the `report` command.

The `report` command arguments are as follows:

- USER *[user name of the person being reported]*
- SCREENSHOT *[screenshot of the issue being reported. preferrably an imgur link]*
- REASON *[a breif explanation of the issue]*


All three of the above arguments are required when using the `report` command. The `report` command itself auto deletes upon use as well to further ensure the privacy of the report.
