# Fun Commands
Want to spice up your server with some fun commands? Here are a few to include!  

**Note:** In this guide, we assume you are using the ``?`` prefix. Syntax is denoted as ``[input]`` for inputs and ``[input1/input2]`` for choice inputs.

## Simple Commands
- ``?8ball [Question]`` Returns an [Magic 8 Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball) response to your question.
  
- ``?blocked`` Shows the [Wumpus Picture](https://dynocc.xyz/files/wumpus.PNG) for blocked users.
  
- ``?depressme`` Shows a [Wumpus Picture](https://dynocc.tk/files/alone.png)
  
- ``?hug [User]`` Sends a message in chat saying that the user hugged the specified person.  
  
- ``?muteme`` Mutes the command user for 10 minutes. This won't work with Moderators because of Dynobot Limitations.  
  
- ``?random`` Shows a random Wumpus Picture.  
  
- ``sacrifice [person/object]`` Sacrifices the specified person or object to a random deity or organization.

- ``deathmatch [user]`` Challenges the user to a randomly chosen trial and sends a direct message notifying them. To use this command, you should also install the ``?roulette`` command in the Mini-Games folder.
