**$1** has been inflicted with Fester

**$1** begins to fester. 


**$1**'s skin starts to fall of, piece by rotting piece. The putrid smell of rotted festering flesh fills the air as **$1** screams in agony.

**$1**'s screams can be heard for miles as **$1**'s flesh continues to fall off **$1**'s bones.

Six gruesome hours later, **$1**'s screams finally stop. All that's left are putrid acidic bones that even the crows won't touch.
