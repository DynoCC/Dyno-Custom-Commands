# Dyno RPG
**Dyno RPG** is a RPG Game made using Dyno Custom Commands and inspired by the infection minigame and a few other custom commands. It is planned to be a community project to be built into something everybody can enjoy. As such everyone is welcome to add their own commands to it as they desire.


## How to
A simple guide for setting up roles and channels for the commands to work as intended


- The `divine-council` channel should be only be useable by serverMods as it is the channel required for using the Divine Council commands.

- When creating the roles for the commands, make sure to determine which roles have which effects. The effects will be entirely up to the ones setting it up, so know that this RPG is best when each role has a specific effect on the one carrying it. 

- The `Adventurer` role is the base role for playing Dyno RPG.

- The channel `the-crypt` was created for use with the `Deceased` role. All people who carry this role are to be considered dead and are only able to continue chatting in here until they have been raised. This channel should be hidden by default to all except the `Deceased` and the `divine-council`.
