# Dyno RPG
Otherwise called **Avelon RPG**, Dyno RPG is a RPG Game made using Dyno CC and inspirted by the infection minigame and a few other custom commands. It is planned to be a community prject to be built into something everybody can enjoy. As such everyone is welcome to add their own commands to it as they desire.


## Registration Commands
This command is used to join the world of Avelon

`register`: Grants the **Adenturer** role and enters you into the forsaken world of Avelon

## Attack Commands
These commands can be used to attack other players, but be warned some come with *side effects*

`blight`: Cast Blight on another Adventurer
`fester`: Cast Fester on another Adventurer
`plague`: Cast a plague infecting all Adventurers
`stab`: Stab another Adventurer 

## Medica Commands
These commands can be used to heal status ailments

`treat`: Cure another Adventurer of all ailments
`cure`: Cure yourself of all ailments
`raise`: Raise another Adventurer from the dead

## Divine Commands
These commands can only be used by the Divine Council *[aka serverMods]*

`divinecure`: Cures all Adventurers of all ailments


### Requirements
For this to work you will need the following roles in your guild:

- `Festered`
- `Blighted`
- `Bleeding`
- `Infected`
- `Cursed`
- `Sacrificed`
- `Adventurer`

As well as the following channels:


- `world-gates`
- `the-crossroads`
- `the-bloodfields`
- `the-deathpit`
- `castle-grounds`
- `castle-courtyard`
- `sacrificial-offerings`
- `divine-council`


### How to
A simple guide for setting up roles and channels for the commands to work as intended

***The `Adventurer` role is the base role for playing Dyno RPG. As such it is suggested to use the role selection menu when adding thse commands to make the commands require it.***

***Deathmatch Commands should be allowed only in `the-deathpits`***

***Divine Council Commands should be limited to serverMod only and only allowed to be used in `divine-council`, while the response can preferaly be set to world-gates` if desired***

***Plaugue and Fester should only be useable if the person calling them is `Infected`***

***Divine Council is not actually a role, it's a nickname for serverMods. as such I decided not to make a seperate role for it.***

***The `rpg-cmds` command should be accessible to `Adveturer` roles only, while the `register` command should be acessible to everyone in th server so people can join Avelon***


### Notes

It is suggested that the `divine-council` channel be useable ONLY by serverMods as it is the channel required for using the Divine Council commands.

***The `Adventurer` role is the base role for playing Dyno RPG. As such it is suggested to use the role selection menu when adding thse commands to make the commands require it.***


***This is a ongoing project and will have more commands added over time. Anyone who wishes to contribute their own commands would of course be much appreciated***
