**{user.username}** has cast Blight on **$1**!

The sound of buzzing can be heard in the distance. **$1** looks up to see what it is. 

As it slowly becomes a roar, **$1**'s eyes widen in horror at the realization. 

A massive swarm of flesh eating locusts is heading in fast, and there's nowhere for **$1** and **{user.username}** to run. 

In retrospect, this was not **{user.username}**'s wisest choice...

**$1** and **{user.username}** both scream in agony as the locusts swarm in, devouring their flesh and picking their bones clean.
