{!role $1 +Cursed}
You have been cursed by {user}!

You attempt to move, but quickly realize you can't. 

You attempt to speak, but can't find your voice. 

You start to panic, hoping, wishing, *praying* somebody will save you. 

But nobody comes.  

You are dead,  cursed to spend eternity in this spot as a silent ghost, watching as all around you live happy, peaceful lives, while you... are forever trapped.
