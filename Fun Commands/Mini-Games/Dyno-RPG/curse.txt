**$1** have been cursed by {user}!

**$1** attempt to move, but quickly realize's they can't. 

**$1** attempt to speak, but can't find their voice. 

**$1** starts to panic, hoping, wishing, *praying* somebody will save them. 

But nobody comes.  

**$1** is dead,  cursed to spend eternity in this spot as a silent ghost, watching as all around you live happy, peaceful lives, while **$1**... is forever trapped.
