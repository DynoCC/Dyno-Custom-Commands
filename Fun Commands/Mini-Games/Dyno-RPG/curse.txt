{!role $1 +Cursed}
**$1** has been cursed...

**$1** attempts to move, but quickly realizes the futility.... 

**$1** attempts to speak, but nothing comes out. 

**$1** starts to panic, hoping, wishing, *praying* for some form of miracle.

But nothing can stop this horror...

**$1** is now dead,  cursed to spend eternity in this spot as a silent ghost, watching as the rest of the world live as happy, peaceful lives, while **$1**... is forever trapped.
