Welcome to the world of Avelon, {user.username}! 

This is a cruel world that the gods have long since forsaken. Darkness and torment lies around every corner, and I cannot guarantee that you will maintain your sanity. But rest assured, the Divine Council will watch over you. 

Now, head forth with caution young Adventurer, and claim your place in this forsaken world.
